Here are some notes for each page on the website:

Home Page: This will mostly remain the same except you'll need to add the date for the MUN conference the school hosts whenever the date is decided. If you need to change the css for this page its in a separate file, home-page.css

About Page: This is page will also mostly be the same. You might be told to add more pictures to the slideshow at the bottom. To add another slide just copy one of the divs with the class "mySlides fade", and change the src in the img element. 
You'll also have to update the numbertext for each div if a new image is added.

Dates Page: This is the page you'll have to work on the most. It contains all the information for the upcoming MUN conference the club is hosting. When the club has a date and topic for the conference this page will contain the date, topic, background guide, and 
schedule. This page will also have the registration form. The form will most likely be a google form which you'll be able to use an iframe for. Google forms provides an iframe for any form. For now this page should probably be updated as it is outdated with
a message saying something along the lines of "thank you to everyone who attented our last conference, this page will be updated soon". You might want to ask Mrs Akamine what should be put here for now as a placeholder since we were never told what to put here.

Contact Page: This will also remain the same. The contact form just sends the information through google forms. You'll probably just want to test the form to make sure its still working. 
The html for the form was generated using this website: https://stefano.brilli.me/google-forms-html-exporter/. The website lets you paste a link to a form and generates the html for it.

        <h3>What is the topic and what do I have to know?</h3>
        <p>Every MUN committee has a topic; however, since this will be the first conference for all of you we will have a topic that is widely known, a pretty common topic, but there isn't an easy solution in the grand scheme of politics.<br><br>The topic that we will be debating this year at TriMUN is Drug Trafficking.</p>
        <p>A number of individuals from each team will be assigned different countries. Normally, for an MUN conference, delegates (the attendees) have to do their own research and write a position paper, since our target audience is beginners we won't require any paper of any sort or any evidence of anyone having reserched. To make this experience as beginner friendly as possible we have built in time so that the groups of delegates can research their countries position and topic on the day of the training MUN. We will provide delegates with a background guide and rough idea of what their position should be.</p>
        <h3>What is the schedule?</h3>
        <p>In the morning there will be a short opening ceremony to briefly explain the goal of the UN and how MUN strives to prepare delegates for the adult world and introduce them to skills such as public speaking, research, compromise, and others. After we will have 5 sessions that will rotate in a clockwise fashion. Once all 5 sessions have been concluded we will have delegatews research their position on the topic. Once the alotted time has run out we will have lunch and then go to the actual debating part of the MUN Training Conference.<br><br>An timetable of the schedule is posted below.</p>
        <p>Some school systems have protocols in place that will not allow access to Google Docs from FCPS, even though the links are set to anyone with the link can view.<br><br>â€‹Advisors from these schools can contact Angela Akamine (akamiang@wcps.k12.md.us) for alternative methods of access for your students.</p>
